            <h2>About the Artist</h2>
            <p>
                Born in Caracas on November 23, 1988. From a young age, Leonel Gonzalez showed an affinity for art.
                At age 12, he took his first brushstrokes under the guidance of visual artist Arturo Mujica at the Jacobo Borges Museum.
                His fearless request to join the adult class set his path. Over the years, Leonel refined his technique while working in a marquetry shop,
                reigniting his love for painting. He now exclusively works with acrylic, capturing hyperrealist scenes with striking detail.
                His works have been admired by icons like Oswaldo Guillen, Omar Vizquel, and Miguel Cabrera.
                “Sometimes I escape and do other things, it's a way to test my skills and indulge a certain whim,
                but then I return to my thing... Horses.”
